  **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
 Project: **FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Priority System**
           A traffic light controller implememted on an FPGA(Field-Programmable Gate Array) allows for flexible and 
           efficient management of traffic flow at intersections.FPGA-based controllers cab be designed to handle complex
           scenarios like varying traffic densities,emergency vehicle prioritizatio and even adaptive timing adjustments
           based on real-time conditions...
